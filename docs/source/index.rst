=====================================

PyRapidML is an open source Python library which not only helps in automating Machine Learning Workflows but also helps in building end to end ML algorithms .
PyRapidML is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as Pycaret, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and many more.

PyRapidML is a low code library which means writing basic and less lines of code, one can achieve high accuracy in their machine learning models.
There's no need to write hefty lines of code as PyRapidML would compare all possible machine learning algorithms to solve your problem in just a single line of code.
Once PyRapidML gives you the best algorithm. You can further tune the model (in just a single line of code) to further tune the model.
